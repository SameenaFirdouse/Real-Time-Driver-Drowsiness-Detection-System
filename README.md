Title: Real-Time Driver Drowsiness Detection System

Description: This project aims to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using facial landmarks and deep learning models.

Features:
Real-time detection of drowsiness using a webcam.
Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for prediction.

Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV for facial landmark detection
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for drowsiness detection

Instructions:
Set up Python environment and necessary libraries (like OpenCV and TensorFlow).
How to run the drowsiness detection model.

Code:
The python code is located in the 'drowsiness_detection.py' file
